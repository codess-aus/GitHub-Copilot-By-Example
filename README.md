# GitHub Copilot By Example

A comprehensive, hands-on workshop for mastering GitHub Copilot with real-world examples, best practices, and production-ready workflows.

## 📚 About

Design, implement, and ship real AI-assisted software with trusted development workflows using GitHub Copilot.

AI-assisted development is no longer a novelty—it's becoming a core skill for modern developers. This workshop goes beyond autocomplete and demos to teach you how to use GitHub Copilot as a true AI pair programmer that understands context, follows your intent, and helps you write cleaner, more secure, production-ready code.

Through real-world examples and guided exercises, you'll explore Copilot's capabilities, Agent Mode, and advanced prompting techniques, while learning practical guardrails for security and maintainability.

## 🎯 What You'll Get

- 🧑‍💻 **65% hands-on learning** with real coding exercises
- ⚡ **Live demos + guided practice** using GitHub Copilot
- 🧠 **Clear mental models** for how Copilot works under the hood
- 🔐 **Best practices** for secure, responsible Copilot usage
- 🤖 **Hands-on experience** with Copilot Agent Mode & integrations
- 🛠️ **Mini end-to-end project** to apply everything you learn
- 📚 **Curated resources** & further learning links
- 💬 **Live Q&A** and peer discussions (in workshop delivery)

## 👥 Who Should Attend?

This workshop is ideal for:

- **Intermediate developers** (Python or C#) who want to work faster with AI
- **Developers curious** about AI-assisted coding beyond basic autocomplete
- **Engineers using** (or planning to use) GitHub Copilot in real projects
- **Teams evaluating** how Copilot fits into production workflows
- **Developers who want to understand** best practices, limitations, and risks of AI-generated code

You don't need to be an AI expert—just comfortable with coding fundamentals and eager to level up how you build software.

## ✅ Learning Outcomes

After completing this workshop, you'll be able to:

- ✓ Use GitHub Copilot confidently as an **AI pair programmer**, not just an autocomplete tool
- ✓ Write, refactor, and document code faster using **effective prompting and context engineering**
- ✓ Understand **when and how to use Copilot Chat vs Agent Mode**
- ✓ **Scaffold real-world components** (APIs, modules, tests) with Copilot assistance
- ✓ Apply **security and quality guardrails** when working with AI-generated code
- ✓ **Review Copilot suggestions critically** and adapt them to your coding style
- ✓ **Integrate Copilot into daily development workflows** with confidence

Walk away knowing how to turn Copilot into a **productivity multiplier**, without losing control of your codebase.
